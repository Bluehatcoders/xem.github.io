      <title>Golfctober 2017</title>
      <description>This year, I tried to follow the trend of #inktober or #blocktober, but adapted to JS code golfing. I bet I could golf (or regolf) one project a day for 31 days, and called it #golfctober. By chance, the whole Codegolf Team, with some excellent new recruits, joined the game and helped me find some awesome new tricks, and save a lot bytes on projects we couldn't golf any more. Here's a recap of all the progress and lessons learned!</description>
